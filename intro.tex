\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction_chap}
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is
an atmospheric modeling system designed for both research and numerical 
weather prediction.  WRF is an open-source community model, and it has been 
adopted for research at universities and governmental laboratories, 
for operational forecasting by governmental and private entities,
and for commercial applications by industry.  WRF development began in the latter 
half of the 1990's with the goals being to build a system shared by research 
and operations and to create a next-generation numerical weather 
prediction (NWP) capability.  The new modeling system has become a 
common platform on which the broad research community 
can develop capabilities that can transition to operations, 
while the extra scrutiny of performance in operations
could guide and accelerate development.  The WRF system was developed
through a partnership of the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) (represented by the National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction (NCEP) and the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)), 
the United States Air Force, the Naval Research Laboratory, the 
University of Oklahoma, and the Federal Aviation Administration.  
For more information 
on the history of the WRF model development see \citet{powers17}.

\section {Advanced Research WRF (ARW)}

ARW is a configuration of the WRF system featuring
the ARW dynamics solver together with other compatible components 
to produce a simulation.  Thus, 
it is a subset of the WRF system that, in addition to the specific solver, 
encompasses physics schemes, numerics/dynamics options, 
initialization routines, and a data assimilation package (WRFDA).  
ARW consists of flexible, modular, portable code that is 
efficient in computing environments ranging from laptops to 
massively-parallel supercomputers and is readily-configurable for 
a variety of applications.  Its extensive menu of options 
for physical process schemes and for configuring numerics  
reflect a history of community input
and make it a powerful NWP tool.  WRFDA offers a variety of data assimilation approaches and that can ingest a 
broad array of observation types.  In addition, for earth system prediction needs 
beyond basic weather forecasting, ARW supports a number of tailored capabilities, including 
WRF-Chem (atmospheric chemistry), 
WRF-Hydro (hydrological modeling), and WRF-Fire (wildland fire modeling).

ARW is supported as a community model, facilitating system development
and broad use for research, operations, and education.  It supports  
atmospheric simulations across scales from large-eddy to global.  
ARW's applications include real-time NWP, weather events and 
atmospheric-process studies, data assimilation development, 
parameterized-physics development, regional climate simulation, air 
quality modeling, atmosphere-ocean coupling, and idealized-atmosphere studies.  

Figure 1.1 depicts the principal components of the ARW system. 
The WRF Software Framework (WSF) is the infrastructure 
that contains the dynamics solver, physics packages, utilities
for initialization, WRFDA, and integrated capabilities such as WRF-Chem, WRF-Hydro, WRF-Fire, etc.  
The WSF also contains the NMM-E dynamics solver, which is used by NCEP in the operational HWRF model.
The Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory of NCAR provides
support for the ARW, and oversees the WRF repository and releases.

This technical note focuses on the scientific and algorithmic 
approaches in the ARW Version 4, including its dynamical solver, physics options,
initialization capabilities, boundary conditions, and grid-nesting techniques.  
The WSF provides the software infrastructure, although this infrastructure is not 
reviewed in this technical note. 
Additionally, while WRF-Chem, WRF-Hydro, WRF-Fire, and other tailored systems 
use the ARW solver, they are also 
not covered by this technical note.  For information on 
actually running the ARW system, the ARW Version 4 Modeling System User's Guide
covers model operation
 
{\noindent(http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user\_guide\_V4/WRFUsersGuide.pdf).  }

The following section highlights the major features of the 
ARW Version 4, first released in May 2018.

{\noindent\bf WRF-Chem, WRF-Hydro and WRF-Fire}
\vskip 12pt

{\em WRF-Chem} is a full online atmospheric chemistry model with many options and some
interactions with the physics via aerosols affecting radiation and microphysics when appropriate
options are chosen. Typically it requires emission source maps as additional inputs.  Further information on WRF-Chem can be found at
https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/

{\em WRF-Hydro} is a surface hydrological model that can be run online with WRF or offline,
interacting with WRF through the land-surface model. This model can calculate the land water
budget terms including streamflow given additional data for routing. It operates on a higher-resolution
sub-grid relative to the atmospheric model.  Further information on WRF-Hydro can be found at
https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf\_hydro/overview

{\em WRF-Fire} operates as a coupled wildland fire model that keeps track of a fire front at the
sub-grid level. It interacts with the model via winds and heat fluxes and requires fuel information as
an additional input.  Further information concerning WRF-Fire can be found at 
http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/fire/wrf-fire.html
and in the ARW Users Guide at
http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user\_guide\_v4/contents.html
